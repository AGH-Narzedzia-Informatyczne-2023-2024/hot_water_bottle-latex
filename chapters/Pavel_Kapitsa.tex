\textbf{Finn the Human}(Figure~\ref{fig:time} on page \pageref{fig:time} po \underline{lewej} stronie) is a human boy who loves nothing more than going on adventures and saving the day. He wears a hat that covers his extremely long flowing yellow hair. He is prone to exclamations and outbursts such as "Mathematical!" and "Algebraic!" Considering himself a hero, Finn has a lust for adventure and swore long ago that he would help anyone in need, but being so full of energy, he has trouble in situations that require him to do tasks other than fighting.
\par
\textbf{Jake the Dog} (Figure~\ref{fig:time} on page \pageref{fig:time} po \underline{prawej} stronie) is Finn's best friend and adoptive brother. He is a 28-year-old—in "magical dog years"—shapeshifting bulldog. The episode "Joshua \& Margaret Investigations" reveals that when Joshua and Margaret—Finn and Jake's parents—were on an investigation, Joshua was bitten by a shape-shifting, other-worldly entity. Joshua, infected by the creature's venom, subsequently birthed Jake from his head. Jake's magic powers allow him to stretch or shrink any part of his body to any shape and size, ranging from becoming gigantic to becoming incredibly small.
