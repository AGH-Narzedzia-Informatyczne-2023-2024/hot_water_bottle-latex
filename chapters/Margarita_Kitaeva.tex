Here is a formula of the magnetic field of an arbitrary flat contour: \[B = \frac{\mu I}{4\pi }\int_{\varphi _1}^{\varphi _2} \frac{d\varphi}{r(\varphi)}\]

And here is a formula of the magnetic field of an infinite wire:
$ B = \frac{\mu I}{2\pi R} $

    \underline{\textbf{13 Reasons Why}} is an American teen drama television series developed for \textit{Netflix} by Brian Yorkey and based on the 2007 novel \emph{"Thirteen Reasons Why" by author Jay Asher}. The series revolves around high school student Clay Jensen (Dylan Minnette) and the aftermath of the suicide of fellow student Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford). Before her death, she leaves behind a box of cassette tapes in which she details the reasons why she chose to end her life as well as the people she believes are responsible for her death. \par
    There are 4 seasons there and each season \emph{except 4th} consists of 13 series \emph{(4th consists of 10 series)}. This serial is really exciting and worth seeing. You can find some really interesting qoutes there. One of my favourites is \underline{this one}:

    {\large I wanna tell you something.}
    
    I took part in some concerts. You can even see a photo from one of them (Figure~\ref{fig:concert} on page \pageref{fig:concert}) It was very valuable experience and I'll \textbf{\emph{always}} remember this day \par
